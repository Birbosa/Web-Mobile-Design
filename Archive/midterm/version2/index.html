               <h3>What Our Customers are Saying</h3>
               <p>
                  I ordered the pajama blue boots in size 8. I have several pairs of uggs and always buy an 8. This pair 
                  arrived and was was to tight. My toes were so squished, I didn't think I could wear them to break them in. 
                  I called customer service and they said that the company has made a few changes to the new boots and they 
                  run a little smaller now. Zappos had the size 9 at my house the next day. They worked great. ORDER SIZE UP 
                  IN CLASSIC 2 FROM YOUR PREVIOUS PURCHASE SIZE IN CLASSIC 1. Love Zappos and Uggs!

                  <li>Today is a rainy day after snow. I avoided the water when I walk on the street, but still the boots, 
                     classic boot II, not water proof at all. Full of water in the boots. And I have to wear it all day. I 
                     bought UGG again because it said water proof

                  <li>If you’re looking for burgundy these are not! They are weighing closer to purple. Very cute but I’m 
                     disappointed in the color
                  </li>
                  <li>I just want to say I LOVED my uggs!! 2 weeks ago I was hit by a drunk driver (thank God I'm here). I 
                     was wearing my uggs at the time. I don't know what did it but my right foot would have been sliced open 
                     from my big toe up my leg to the top of my boot, had I not had them on. It was my boot that got sliced 
                     instead and I only ended up with 2 little cuts on my foot and leg. I would definitely love to own another pair.

             I could not find any funny company descriptions that I wanted to include.  So... Here is some history of RIT.</p>
             <p>RIT was born of an unlikely institutional marriage of an influential cultural association, the Rochester Athenaeum, 
             founded in 1829, and a technical training school, the Mechanics Institute, founded in 1885. The institute adopted the name 
             Rochester Institute of Technology in 1944 and awarded its first bachelor of science degree in 1955. A 1961 decision to 
             leave downtown Rochester for farmland in the suburban town of Henrietta put RIT on its path to pre-eminence as a 
             global university. Today, the university’s reputation and reach go well beyond Rochester. We have partnerships on 
             nearly every continent and overseas campuses located in China, Croatia, Dubai, and Kosovo.
